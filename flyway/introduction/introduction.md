<br />


A key concept of the above definition is the notion of a _"database migration"_. Within the context of discussing _Flyway_, a _"database migration"_ is a group of one or more database changes. In order to keep track of migrations, _Flyway_ creates a table (per schema) that maintains a history of all migrations for a specific schema.

Flyway supports 2 forms of migration namely **_versioned_** and **_repeatable_** migrations.

* _Versioned_
  
  * Has a version number, checksum, and description. The version number ensures that migrations are unique. The checksum helps prevent accidental changes from being migrated. The description provides metadata about the migration.
  * Versioned migrations are applied in order and only once
  * An _"undo migration"_ having the same version number can be provided

* _Repeatable_

  * Has a description and checksum but a version number is not required.
  * Repeatable migrations can be re-applied everytime their checksum changes.
  * Always applied after _versioned_ migrations.

Historically, migrations could only be written in Java and/or SQL. However, as of the time of this writing (circa October 2025), Flyway also supports NoSQL database migrations where migrations can be written for example in:

- "CQL" for Cassandra
- Javascript for MongoDB

The history of **Redgate Flyway** is the story of a successful open-source project being acquired and further developed by a leading Database DevOps company.

## üèõÔ∏è Flyway History

Flyway began as a highly popular open-source database migration tool. Its history with Redgate began in 2019, marking a significant evolution from a community-driven CLI tool to an enterprise-grade Database DevOps solution with both free and commercial editions, leveraging Redgate's established database tooling expertise.

### Origins as Flyway (Open Source)

- **Initial Development:** Flyway was originally developed as an open-source database migration tool, primarily by **Axel Fontaine**.

- **Purpose:** It was created to simplify and automate database migrations across multiple platforms using a "migrations-based" approach, where changes are applied through a sequence of versioned scripts (primarily SQL or Java).

- **Adoption:** Flyway gained significant traction within the development community. By 2018, it had over 11.5 million downloads, and it was noted on the [Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) as a technology to "Adopt." It supported a wide range of databases, including Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

### Acquisition by Redgate

- **The Acquisition:** In **July 2019**, Flyway was acquired by **Redgate Software**, a company already specializing in Database DevOps tools, particularly for SQL Server (like SQL Compare and SQL Source Control, which use a "state-based" approach). Redgate committed to investing in Flyway's continued development.

- **Strategic Move:** This acquisition was a major step for Redgate, allowing them to rapidly expand their offerings to support cross-platform database DevOps and a migrations-based approach, complementing their existing state-based tools.

- **Continued Open Source:** Redgate committed to maintaining and supporting the free, open-source **Flyway Community** version under the Apache v2 license.

### Development as Redgate Flyway

Since the acquisition, Redgate has significantly invested in and expanded the Flyway product line:

- **2019-2020:** Redgate quickly integrated its technology, bringing its market-leading database comparison engine to Flyway. This enabled advanced features like:
    * **Object-level Versioning:** Capturing the history of database changes at the individual object level.
    * **Auto-generation of Migration Scripts:** Automatically creating migration scripts by comparing the database state.

- **Post-Acquisition Product Expansion:** The product evolved into a tiered offering to support different team sizes and enterprise needs:
  - **Flyway Community:** The free, open-source version.
  - **Flyway Teams (and later, Flyway Enterprise):** Paid versions that build upon the open-source core, adding advanced features necessary for team collaboration, automation, compliance, and support for a greater number of database systems.
- **Flyway Desktop:** A new **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** was introduced for Windows, Mac, and Linux to help developers more easily author, track, and understand database changes, integrating Flyway with Redgate's comparison technology.

- **Expanded Support:** Redgate continued to broaden Flyway's compatibility, increasing its multi-DBMS support from over 20 to an ever-growing **50+ database systems** today, including Snowflake and cloud platforms.

## üîë Key Features

- **Migration Scripts**: Uses SQL or Java-based scripts to apply incremental changes, with automatic tracking of applied migrations via a metadata table.

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Docker, and Java environments, and supports databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and more.

- **Enterprise Edition**: Offers advanced capabilities such as object-level version control, data masking, and enhanced reporting for complex deployments.

- **Community and Simplicity**: The core tool is lightweight and focused, with a command-line interface, Maven/Gradle plugins, and API integration for easy adoption.

- **Version-Controlled Migrations**: Store changes as numbered SQL scripts (e.g., `V1__Create_users_table.sql`) in your VCS. Flyway applies them in order, tracking applied versions in a metadata table (`flyway_schema_history`) to prevent re-execution.

- **Script Generation and Undo Support**: Automatically generates forward migration and rollback (undo) scripts for schema objects like tables, views, and stored procedures, reducing manual errors.

- **Dependency Management**: Handles complex inter-object dependencies, ensuring safe ordering during deployments.

- **Drift Detection and Validation**: Compares database states across environments to identify schema drift; includes pre-deployment checks and code analysis for quality gates.

- **CI/CD Automation**: Integrates seamlessly with pipelines for automated testing, including unit/integration tests and left-shifted development (early error detection).

- **Audit and Compliance Tools**: Provides full traceability with deployment histories, supporting regulations like GDPR, SOX, or HIPAA.

- **Cross-Platform Execution**: Runs via Command-Line Interface (CLI), Desktop GUI, API (e.g., Java-based), or Docker containers on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Advanced Analytics**: In enterprise editions, AI-driven insights help predict deployment risks and optimize change management.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Flyway Works

Flyway follows a convention-over-configuration model:

1. **Develop Changes**: Write migration scripts in your IDE, committing them to VCS alongside application code.

2. **Baseline Existing Databases**: For legacy systems, create a baseline script to mark the current state as versioned.

3. **Validate and Test**: Run `flyway validate` or `check` in CI to ensure scripts are correct and dependencies are met.

4. **Migrate**: Execute `flyway migrate` to apply pending scripts. Flyway locks the database during application to avoid conflicts.

5. **Monitor and Rollback**: Use `flyway info` for status, `undo` for reversions, or `repair` to fix metadata issues.

6. **Deploy Across Environments**: Integrate with pipelines to promote changes from dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí prod, with environment-specific configs (e.g., via `flyway.conf`).

This process ensures databases evolve predictably, with each deployment being idempotent and auditable. For example, in a microservices setup, Flyway can run migrations on application startup via its API.
