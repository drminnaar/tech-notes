# Flyway README

The notes in this section are inspired by an article (that I read a few years ago) describing the concept of evolutionary database design. The article can be found [here - Evolutionary Database Design (Martin Fowler)](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html). In the article, reference was made to a number of database migration tools. [Flyway](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd) was one of the tools mentioned. As it turns out, it is _Flyway_ that I adopted in the end. Since then, Flyway has also been acquired by [Redgate](https://www.red-gate.com/).

This section covers topics relating to both the theory and practice of using [RedGate Flyway](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd) with various database systems (SQL and NoSQL).
