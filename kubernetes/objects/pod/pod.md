## Overview

> [!TIP]
> **Grok AI Prompt:** Explain a Kubernetes Pod to me like I'm 5 years old.  
> 
> Imagine a Pod as a tiny spaceship in a big space station called Kubernetes. This spaceship is the smallest thing that can fly on its own. Inside the spaceship, there are one or more little robots (called containers) that work together to do a job, like carrying cargo or sending messages. 
> 
> All the robots in the spaceship share the same space, so they can talk to each other easily and use the same tools, like a shared radio or fuel tank. Kubernetes makes sure the spaceship stays safe, has enough power, and gets to the right place in the space station.
> 
> If something goes wrong, like the spaceship breaks, Kubernetes can fix it or make a new one to keep the job going! **So, a Pod is just a cozy home for robots working as a team.**

To better understand what "smallest deployable unit" means, the information below compares Kubernetes, VMWare and Docker. By understanding how these three technologies handle workload scheduling and management, one is able to better understand what a Pod is, and how it is scheduled (deployed).

This can be broken down as follows:

- **VMware**: Smallest deployable unit is the Virtual Machine (VM)

  Using the hypervisor, the hypervisor's primary job is to create and manage virtual machines (VMs). The hypervisor allocates CPU, memory, and storage to each VM. When you need to scale or move a workload, you're moving the entire VM. The VM is the smallest, indivisible component that the system can schedule and run.

- **Docker**: Smallest deployable unit is the Container

  While Docker can schedule and run multiple containers on a single host, the core unit it manages is the container. The docker run command starts a single container. Docker doesn't have a built-in concept of grouping multiple containers together as a single deployable unit. To the Docker engine, each container is an independent entity that it schedules and manages.

- **Kubernetes**: Smallest deployable unit is the Pod

  Kubernetes is designed to orchestrate and manage containerized applications at a higher level. While Kubernetes uses containers, it doesn't schedule them directly. Instead, it schedules Pods.

## Where do Pods fit into the Cluster Architecture

Pods operate in the data plane, managed by the Kubelet and container runtime on worker nodes, while the control plane (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd) orchestrates their creation, scheduling, and lifecycle.

üé® The following diagram represents a view of the Kubernetes Data Plane. The primary components of the Data Plane are highlighted with `Pod` represented by number ‚ùπ.

![Data Plane](../images/data-plane.png)

### Deployment in the Data Plane

- Pods are scheduled by the Scheduler (control plane) to run on specific worker nodes in the data plane.

- The Kubelet on each node interacts with the container runtime to create, monitor, and manage pods.

- Kube-proxy ensures network connectivity to pods, using services to expose them internally or externally.

### Interaction with Control Plane

- Pods are defined via YAML/JSON manifests submitted to the API Server.

- The Controller Manager uses higher-level abstractions like Deployments or ReplicaSets to manage pods, ensuring the desired number of replicas are running.

- The Scheduler decides which node a pod runs on based on resource availability, node affinity, or taints/tolerations.

- Pod status is stored in etcd and updated by the Kubelet through the API Server.

### Example Pod Workflow

- A user defines a pod in a YAML file (e.g., specifying a container image like nginx).
- The manifest is sent to the API Server.
- The Scheduler assigns the pod to a suitable node.
- The Kubelet on that node pulls the container image and starts the pod.
- Kube-proxy sets up networking rules to allow traffic to the pod.
- The pod runs, and its status is reported back to the API Server and stored in etcd.

### Pods and Higher-Level Abstractions

Pods are rarely managed directly in production. Instead, they are orchestrated by controllers like:

- **Deployments**: Manage pod replicas and updates.
- **ReplicaSets**: Ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running.
- **StatefulSets**: Manage pods with stable identities for stateful applications.
- **DaemonSets**: Run one pod per node for system-level tasks.

## Key Components of a Kubernetes Pod Architecture

A Kubernetes Pod is designed to encapsulate application containers, their shared resources, and policies for managing those containers. The following are the core architectural components found within a Pod:

1. Containers

   - The principal component of any Pod; these contain your application code and run the workload.

   - A Pod may consist of a single container or multiple, tightly coupled containers (sidecars, helpers).

2. Init Containers and Ephemeral Containers

   - Init Containers: Run before main application containers start, often used for initialization tasks.

   - Ephemeral Containers: Can be injected for debugging purposes without restarting the Pod.

3. Shared Storage Volumes

   - All containers in a Pod can access shared filesystem volumes.

   - These allow persistent data sharing among containers and can attach to persistent storage for data retention.

4. Pod Network Namespace (and Resources)

   - Every Pod has a unique IP address shared by all its containers.

   - Containers in a Pod share the same network namespace, enabling communication via localhost and shared port space.

   - Communication outside the Pod requires service exposure or networking configuration.

5. Pod Specification (PodSpec)

   - Defines the containers, storage, networking, and scheduling details of the Pod.

   - Includes resource requests/limits, environment variables, and lifecycle hooks.

6. Linux Namespaces and cgroups

   - Provides isolation among containers through OS-level mechanisms for resource separation and security.

7. Labels and Metadata

   - Every Pod carries metadata such as labels, used for organization, scheduling, and managing the Pod via higher-level controllers.

---

## Key Characteristics of a Pod

1. **Container Grouping**: A Pod can contain one or multiple containers (e.g., a main app container and a sidecar like a logging agent). These containers share resources like network (localhost communication) and storage volumes.

2. **Shared Life Cycle**: A Pod's containers are all created, started, and destroyed together. If one container fails, the entire Pod is considered failed and is handled by Kubernetes' control plane.

3. **Shared Network**: All containers in a Pod share a single IP address and port space, communicating via `localhost`. Kubernetes assigns a unique IP to each Pod for cluster-wide communication.

4. **Shared Storage**: Containers in a Pod can share storage volumes, enabling data exchange or persistent storage access.

5. **Ephemeral Nature**: Pods are designed to be short-lived and disposable/expendable (ie. not persistent). If a Pod fails, Kubernetes (via controllers like Deployments and ReplicaSet) does not try to restart the Pod; instead it replaces it with a new one.

6. **Lifecycle**: A Pod's lifecycle is managed by Kubernetes through use of high-level controllers like Deployments, StatefulSets, and Jobs. It goes through various states like Pending, Running, Succeeded, and Failed.

7. **Atomic Scheduling**: Kubernetes schedules Pods as a single unit to a node, ensuring all containers in a Pod run together on the same machine.

8. **Single Responsibility**: The best practice is to design Pods with a single responsibility. This means one Pod usually runs one main application or process. Use multiple containers in a single Pod only when they are highly dependent on each other and/or tightly coupled.
   
9. **Security and Isolation**: Pods implement Linux namespaces and cgroups, providing isolation between containers. You can further control security using SecurityContext and network policies (NetworkPolicy objects restrict Pod traffic).

10. **Pod Metadata and Management**:
   
   - **Labels and selectors**: Pods use labels for identification and grouping, which controllers use to select and manage them.
   - **Affinities, priorities, and disruption budgets**: Control where Pods are placed, their importance during resource crunch, and their resilience during voluntary disruptions.

11. **Best Practice**:
    
    - Don‚Äôt create Pods directly for production workloads; use Deployments, StatefulSets, Jobs, etc., to manage desired state and scaling.
    - Use probes (liveness, readiness, startup) for robust health checks.
    - Manage configuration with ConfigMaps and secrets, and attach Volumes for persistent storage.

## Common Use Cases

### Single-container Pod
  
Runs one container that encapsulates an entire application. This could be anything from a web server like Nginx, a database like PostgreSQL, or a microservice for a larger application. These Pods are often managed by a higher-level controller like a Deployment, ReplicaSet or a StatefulSet to ensure they are always running and scalable.

Example Pod Definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: webapp
    image: nginx:latest
```

### Multi-container Pod
  
- Runs multiple containers that are tighly coupled and need to work closely together (dependant on one or the other), like an app with a logging sidecar or a proxy. Typically, a Pod uses the Sidecar Pattern.

> [!TIP]
>
> The sidecar pattern in Kubernetes is a design approach where a secondary container, called a sidecar, runs alongside the main application container within the same pod to provide additional functionality or enhance the primary container's capabilities. The sidecar container shares the same lifecycle, resources, and network namespace as the main container, enabling tight integration while maintaining modularity.
> See [official Kubernetes documentation on Sidecar Pattern](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/04/22/multi-container-pods-overview/#the-origins-of-the-sidecar-pattern).

- Essential multi-container patterns:

  - Init Container Pattern (Architectural Pattern): used to run setup tasks before the main application container starts. This is a broader architectural concept or design pattern that describes the practice of using a separate, short-lived process or container to perform initialization or setup tasks for a main application. The Kubernetes Init Container feature is a direct implementation of this pattern within the Kubernetes ecosystem.
  
  - Ambassador Pattern: uses a dedicated sidecar container to act as a proxy for the main application container within the same Pod. This proxy container intercepts and manages network requests, handling tasks like routing, load balancing, or TLS termination. The main application container then communicates with the proxy on localhost, simplifying its own code.

  - Configuration Helper: uses a sidecar container to dynamically fetch and update configuration for the main application container. Instead of baking configuration files into the application image, the sidecar container pulls the latest configuration from an external source and places it in a shared volume. The main application then reads this configuration from the volume.

  - Adapter Pattern: uses a sidecar container to standardize the output of the main application container. The adapter container runs alongside the main application and translates its output into a format that is expected by other services, a monitoring system, or an external log aggregator.

Example Pod Definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: webapp
    image: nginx:latest
  - name: sidecar
    image: fluentd:latest
```

### Init Containers

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Kubernetes provides a built-in mechanism (Init Containers) to easily implement the _Init Container Pattern (general architectural pattern)_.

Init Containers can be summarised as follows:

- Special containers in a Pod that run setup tasks (e.g., database initialization) before the main containers start.
- Unlike regular containers, init containers run to completion and then terminate, ensuring that initialization conditions for the main application are met.
- They are useful for tasks that need to be performed once at startup, such as setting up a database or cloning a Git repository to a shared volume.
  - Pre-populating a database: An Init Container runs a script to create a database schema or load initial data before the main application container, which relies on that database, starts.
  - Preparing a file system: An Init Container clones a Git repository into a shared volume so the main container can access the code or configuration files.
  - Waiting for a service: An Init Container can wait until a dependent service, like a database or another microservice, is available before allowing the main application to start.
- The main application container won't start until all Init Containers have successfully finished.

> [!NOTE]
>
> [See Example 4: Init Containers](#example-4---init-container) for an example of how to configure an init container.

Example Pod Definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: init-setup
    image: busybox:latest
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Initializing..." && sleep 5']
  containers:
  - name: webapp
    image: nginx:alpine
```

## Lifecycle and Management

- If a node fails, Kubernetes reschedules Pods to healthy nodes (managed by higher-level controllers).

- Pods are ephemeral by design. They are created by controllers (`Deployments`, `StatefulSets`) or directly via YAML/JSON manifests. 

- A Pod will run until completion (for one-off tasks like Jobs) or replacement/termination (for long running apps), and not intended to be restarted directly if they fail (controllers are used for that).

- Through a process of "binding", Pod's are scheduled to nodes based on resource availability, affinities, taints/tolerations, and other constraints; once bound, they stay on that node until deleted or evicted (e.g., due to node failure or resource shortages). 

- Direct Pod creation is rare; instead, use higher-level abstractions like Deployments (for stateless apps), StatefulSets (for stateful ones), or Jobs (for batch tasks) to manage replication, updates, and self-healing. 

- Updates are limited. Metadata like name/namespace is immutable, but you can patch fields like container images or add ephemeral containers; major changes often require recreating the Pod via its controller. 

- Phases include Pending (scheduling), Running (containers active), Succeeded/Failed (completed), and Unknown; track status with conditions like PodReady.

  According to [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-phase): "A Pod's status field is a [PodStatus](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.33/#podstatus-v1-core) object, which has a phase field."

  | Phase | Description |
  | ---| --- |
  | Pending | The Pod has been accepted, but waiting for containers to be set up and made ready to run. |
  | Running |  The Pod is bound to a node, all containers are created, and at least one container is running, starting, or restarting. |
  | Succeeded | All containers in the Pod have terminated successfully and will not be restarted. |
  | Failed | All containers have terminated, but at least one failed (e.g., exited with non-zero status or terminated by the system), and no restarts are planned. |
  | Unknown | The Pod's state cannot be determined, typically due to communication errors with the node. |

- Static Pods are a special case: Managed directly by the kubelet on a node (e.g., for control plane components), with read-only mirror Pods in the API server for visibility. 

- Other lifecycle aspects: `Init containers` for initialization tasks, `ephemeral containers` for debugging, and `lifecycle hooks` for custom behaviors.

### Example 2 - Run Multiple Pods

The objective of this example is to show how to create containers in separate Pods and enable communication between the 2 Pods.

This example demonstrates the following:

- create a web server Pod (Nginx container) using a Pod definition
- create a logging Pod (Busybox container) using a Pod definition
  - pass in web server IP address as environment variables
  - continuously ping web server using web server IP address


1Ô∏è‚É£ **Generate Pod definitions:**

The following kubectl commands using `--dry-run=client` flag, is used to preview Pod that would be sent to the cluster, without actually submitting it to the Kubernetes API server. It will perform client-side validation and generate the Pod's definition (`YAML` in this instance), but it won't actually be submitted to API Server.

Furthermore, the command `tee webapp.yaml` reads the Pod yaml and writes it to both standard output (terminal) and a file.

- Save `webapp` Pod preview to `webapp.yaml`

  ```bash
  kubectl run webapp --image=nginx:alpine --dry-run=client -o yaml | tee webapp.yaml
  ```

  ```console
  üñ•Ô∏è <<output>> üñ•Ô∏è

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    labels:
      run: webapp
    name: webapp
  spec:
    containers:
    - image: nginx:alpine
      name: webapp
      resources: {}
    dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
    restartPolicy: Always
  status: {}
  ```

- Apply `webapp.yaml` Pod spec:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ./webapp.yaml
  ```

  ```console
  üñ•Ô∏è <<output>> üñ•Ô∏è

  pod/webapp created
  ```

- Save `busyapp` Pod preview to `busyapp.yaml`
  
  ```bash
  WEBAPP_ID=$(kubectl get pod/webapp -o wide | awk '/webapp/ { print $6 }')

  kubectl run busyapp --image=busybox:latest --env="WEBAPP_ID=$WEBAPP_ID" --dry-run=client -o yaml -- bin/sh -c 'while true; do ping -c 1 $WEBAPP_ID; sleep 5; done' | tee busyapp.yaml
  ```

  ```console
  üñ•Ô∏è <<output>> üñ•Ô∏è

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    labels:
      run: busyapp
    name: busyapp
  spec:
    containers:
    - args:
      - bin/sh
      - -c
      - while true; do ping -c 1 $WEBAPP_ID; sleep 5; done
      env:
      - name: WEBAPP_ID
        value: 10.1.0.51
      image: busybox:latest
      name: busyapp
      resources: {}
    dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
    restartPolicy: Always
  status: {}
  ```

- Apply `busyapp.yaml` Pod spec:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ./busyapp.yaml
  ```

  ```console
  üñ•Ô∏è <<output>> üñ•Ô∏è

  pod/busyapp created
  ```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **View Pods:**

### Example 3 - Run Multi-Container Pod (sidecar)

In this example we create a single Pod that contains a web server container and a logging sidecar container.

I'll provide an example of a Kubernetes Pod configuration that uses an Nginx container with a sidecar container for logging purposes. This example demonstrates a common pattern where a sidecar container collects and processes logs from the main Nginx application.

#### Pod Spec: Multi-Container

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webapp
  labels:
    app: webapp-demo
spec:
  containers:
  # Nginx web server
  - name: web-server
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: log-volume
      mountPath: /var/log/nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "256Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      requests:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "250m"

  # Sidecar for log processing
  - name: log-sidecar
    image: busybox:latest
    command: ["/bin/sh"]

  - name: log-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

Pod Definition:

- The Pod is named `webapp` and labeled with app: `webapp-demo` for easy identification and selection.

Primary Container (Nginx Web Server):

- Uses the `nginx:alpine` image.
- Exposes `port 80` for web traffic.
- Mounts a shared `emptyDir` volume at `/var/log/nginx` to store Nginx logs.
- Resource limits and requests are set to ensure reasonable resource allocation.

Sidecar Container (Log Processor):

- Uses the lightweight `busybox:latest` image for simplicity.
- Runs a `tail -f` command to continuously monitor the Nginx access log (access.log) from the shared volume.
- Mounts the same `emptyDir` volume at `/logs` to access Nginx logs.
- Has its own resource limits and requests to avoid resource contention. Note that this container has been configured to use less resources

Shared Volume:

- An `emptyDir` volume named `log-volume` is used to share log files between the Nginx container and the sidecar.
- The Nginx container writes logs to `/var/log/nginx`, and the sidecar reads them from `/logs`.

#### Deploy Steps: Multi-Container Pod

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create Pod spec file (yaml):**

```bash
cat <<EOF > webapp.yaml

    volumeMounts:
    - name: log-volume
      mountPath: /var/log/nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "256Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      requests:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "250m"

  # Sidecar for log processing
  - name: log-sidecar
    image: busybox:latest
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "tail -f /logs/access.log"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: log-volume
      mountPath: /logs
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "200m"
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "100m"

  volumes:
  - name: log-volume
    emptyDir: {}

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Verify status of both containers (`web-server`, and `log-sidecar`):**

There is currently no support to query status of Pod containers directly. Therefore, try one of the following methods to get more information on the containers running within the Pod.

- <ins>**Method 1**</ins>: Use [jq (lightweight command-line JSON processor)](https://jqlang.org/download/) for the following command.

  ```bash
  kubectl get pod/webapp -o json | jq '[.spec.containers[] as $container | .status.containerStatuses[] | select(.name == $container.name) | {"name": .name, "image": $container.image, "status": .state, "ready": .ready, "restarts": .restartCount}]'
  ```

  ```json
  üñ•Ô∏è <<output>> üñ•Ô∏è

  [
    {
      "name": "web-server",
      "image": "nginx:alpine",
      "status": {
        "running": {
          "startedAt": "2025-08-12T00:00:00Z"
        }
      },
      "ready": true,
      "restarts": 0
    },
    {
      "name": "log-sidecar",
      "image": "busybox:latest",
      "status": {
        "running": {
          "startedAt": "2025-08-12T00:00:00Z"
        }
      },
      "ready": true,
      "restarts": 0
    }
  ]
  ```

- <ins>**Method 2**</ins>: Use `grep` (linux command-line utility for searching plaintext datasets for lines that match a regular expression).

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Test Logging:**

Kubernetes defaults to showing the logs of the **first container** defined in the pod specification (`web-server` in our example). Therefore, the following command will output logs for the `web-server` container.

```bash
kubectl logs pod/webapp
```

 If you want to view the logs for a specific container, you must explicitly specify its name using the `-c` flag.

```bash
kubectl logs pod/webapp -c web-server
kubectl logs pod/webapp -c log-sidecar
```

Let's generate some web server logs by sending a few http requests to the webserver app. First, enable port forwarding as follows:

```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/webapp 8080:80
```

```console
üñ•Ô∏è <<output>> üñ•Ô∏è

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 80
```

Send 3 requests to `web-server`:

```bash
seq 3 | xargs -Iz curl http://localhost:8080
```

View `log-sidecar` container logs:

```bash
k logs pod/webapp -c log-sidecar
```

```console
üñ•Ô∏è <<output>> üñ•Ô∏è

127.0.0.1 - - [09/Aug/2025:22:15:54 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 615 "-" "curl/8.5.0" "-"

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Verify status of init container (`init-setup`):**

There is currently no support to query status of init containers directly. Therefore, try one of the following methods to get more information on the containers running within the Pod.

- <ins>**Method 1**</ins>: Use [jq (lightweight command-line JSON processor)](https://jqlang.org/download/) for the following command.

  ```bash
  kubectl get pod/webapp -o json | jq '[.spec.initContainers[] as $container | .status.initContainerStatuses[] | select(.name == $container.name) | {"name": .name, "image": $container.image, "status": .state, "ready": .ready, "restarts": .restartCount}]'
  ```

  ```json
  üñ•Ô∏è <<output>> üñ•Ô∏è

  [
    {
      "name": "init-setup",
      "image": "busybox:latest",
      "status": {
        "terminated": {
          "containerID": "docker://c9a01439b2ae9ddd97b61f29f6ee848a5711ff6b47917390f6743221918bf4fe",
          "exitCode": 0,
          "finishedAt": "2025-08-13T03:31:35Z",
          "reason": "Completed",
          "startedAt": "2025-08-13T03:31:26Z"
        }
      },
      "ready": true,
      "restarts": 0
    }
  ]
  ```

- <ins>**Method 2**</ins>: Use `sed` (Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language).

> [!TIP]

> Learn more about `sed` using AI prompt:

> Explain the Linux sed utility, including its purpose, basic syntax, and common use cases? Provide examples of how to use sed for tasks like text substitution, deleting lines, and pattern matching in files.
