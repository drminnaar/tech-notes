## Client-Server Model

See [Client-Server model](https://grokipedia.com/page/Client%E2%80%93server_model) for a detailed description.

The _Client/Server Architecture_ is a computing model where tasks are divided between service/resource requesters (clients) and service/resource providers (servers). Clients send requests for data or services over a network, and the server responds by processing these requests and delivering the required resources back to the clients. The server hosts, manages, and delivers most resources, while the client consumes services/resource. This setup enables multiple clients to access resources from a centralized server, commonly seen in web applications, email, and file sharing. This model enables centralized management, scalability, and efficient resource sharing.
